Our tactics with targeted prompts using AIDCA and Cialdini's principles transformed our advertising campaign from generic pitches to tailored messages. Each email now pulls in Attention, piques Interest with specific benefits, creates a want or urgency for the products and services that augment desire, builds trust with proof points, and drives Action with a clear next step. 

Taking direction from the AI with specific instructions we have evolved from vague copy to messages that land exactly for each audience as we intended. As a Growth Analyst, I firmly believe in a hands-on and data-led approach when moving to a new process. Dashboards are not a series of data numbers to me; they're a signal of an action. When I notice that there was a gap in the process? Like noticing high email opens but little meetings booked with the email audience? Then I try to see why (maybe the call-to-action was not significant) and formulate new prompts to see how quickly I can test other wording, descriptions etc. 

This might be a cycle that looks like Plan-Do-Study-Act where after I make a change, I measure, hypothesize, tweak, review asses. Each step keeps us wired to making decisions based off real-time data feedback to simulate a 'test & learn' environment (albeit not a perfect one). In terms of practice, I have changed the wording based on what the data is informing me (ex. to ensure we have stronger social proof, emphasize urgency, or be more explicit in targeting our audience while ultimately implementing each tactic simultaneously in order to ensure persistent growth).
