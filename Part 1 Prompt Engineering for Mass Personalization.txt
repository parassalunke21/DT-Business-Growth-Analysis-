Prompt Engineering for Mass Personalization

Introduction
This submission includes two AI prompts designed to generate personalized B2B outbound emails using the AIDCA framework and Cialdini’s persuasion principles. The prompts target a CTO of a D2C e-commerce startup and a COO of a mid-size Pharma SME, ensuring tailored, persuasive messaging that avoids generic pitfalls. Sample email outputs are included to demonstrate the prompts’ effectiveness.
