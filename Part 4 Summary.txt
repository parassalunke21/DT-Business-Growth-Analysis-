Crafting targeted prompts with AIDCA and Cialdini principles transformed the campaign narrative from broad pitches to personalized, stage-specific persuasion. Each email now has a clear hook (Attention), a tailored interest-builder, urgency in Desire, trust signals in Conviction, and a compelling call to Action. By explicitly instructing the AI, we moved beyond generic copy to data-driven messaging that speaks to each persona’s motivations. As a Growth Analyst, I embrace an iterative, metrics-driven mindset. I view dashboards as decision cues, not just numbers. When a metric gap appears (e.g., high opens but low meetings), I form hypotheses (perhaps the CTA is weak) and use AI prompts to test new messaging quickly. This feedback loop – measure, hypothesize, prompt, evaluate – aligns strategy to real-time signals. In practice, I pivot the narrative based on insights (adding social proof, creating urgency, or refining targeting) to pull the right levers for sustained growth.
